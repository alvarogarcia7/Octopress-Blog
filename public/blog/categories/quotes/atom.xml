    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I finished “Snow Crash” and it was quite nice. The concept of linguistic malware was interesting and ahead of its time.
I noticed that the term “Virus” was used correctly in the book as the malware
 was not propagating between people (then it would become a worm).
Although I suspect it was due to the fact that most people (read almost everyone)
 calls any malware a “virus”. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any information system of sufficient complexity will inevitably become
infected with viruses - viruses generated from within itself.</p>

  <p><cite>Neal Stephensen - Snow Crash</cite></p>
