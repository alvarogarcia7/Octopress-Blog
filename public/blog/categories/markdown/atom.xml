    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown looks like an easy-ish language to start (probably not so easy to master of course).
Although compared to writing LaTeX source, it is a breeze. During my last year at JHU I started writing the reports and what not directly into LaTeX,
I think using MarkDown for blogging and MS Office at work is going to take away my old skills.</p>

<p>On a side note, I am now up to around 500 million cookies per second (CpS) in
<strong><a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a></strong>. I was stuck at 200 million CpS for a week or so until I could start making Antimatter Condensers. I may have missed them before
as they were not visible in the side-bar and I had to scroll down to see them.</p>
