So I finished "Snow Crash" and it was quite nice. The concept of linguistic malware was interesting and ahead of its time.
I noticed that the term "Virus" was used correctly in the book as the malware
 was not propagating between people (then it would become a worm).
Although I suspect it was due to the fact that most people (read almost everyone)
 calls any malware a "virus". Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable read.
