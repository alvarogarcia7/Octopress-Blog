It's been a while. I know I should have updated more frequently but lazyness prevails.  
Anyway, I was busy doing Fireeye's FlARE challenges for a month or so (it was depressing to see people finish in 10 hours :\). You can find the challenges at [http://flare-on.com](http://flare-on.com). I learned a lot doing them. They will release solutions in 2 weeks. I am also working on a writeup which I will release then. I think it will be interesting as it will be a n00b's perspective.

And finally. "Good news everyone!" I am transitioning a more reverse engineering oriented role at my day job. YAY :)
